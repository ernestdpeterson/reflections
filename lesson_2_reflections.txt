What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you deed to do it?
    It creates a metadata file so you can track chainges to the files you want 
    to track
    
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
    The working dir is a folder holding all the files. The repository is holing
    all the commit points as metadata so the staging area might be for monitoring
    files to commit.
    
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?
    By verifying that you have only added the file with one logical change.
