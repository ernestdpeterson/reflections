    to track
    
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
    The working dir is a folder holding all the files. The repository is holing
    all the commit points as metadata so the staging area might be for monitoring
    files to commit.
    
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?
    By verifying that you have only added the file with one logical change.
    
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
    Any time you want to create an alternate version of what you are working on
    but still have the original. Branches alow for multiple working versions.
    
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
    They give you a visual representation of the conection flow of the commits.
