 was introduced?
     By conpairing two small elements that are supposed to be identicle you have 
     a graeter chance of spotting the difference.
     
 How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?
    The pros are that the save would make some sense as to their content. The 
    cons are that it is totaly in your control and if you aren't diligent you 
    will create a mess or nothing at all.

Why do you think some vearsion control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
    Because Git is focased on programmers and their needs while G. Docs is for
    documents.
    
How can you use comands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    git log gives you a list of revisions and git diff shows the diffences
    
 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
 could break something?
    You have an easy out if you break it. You can just go back to a previous 
    version.
    
Now that you ahve your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
